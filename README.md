[Polygo: educational computer science website](https://github.com/nowji/Polygo)
Polygo is a way to learn and stay familiar with data structures and algorithms. Whether you are just starting to learn them or have studied them in the past, Polygo offers a fun way to get practice without needing to pick up a textbook. Inspired by Duolingo's gamified approach to learning a language, we hoped to replicate the experience to help developers prepare for interviews.
